# react-deployment-s3
This repository serves as a template for a client-side React.js application that leverages [Material UI][https://mui.com/] as the front-end framework.  It contains a GitHub Action that will deploy to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket of your choice.  The intent is to create an automated pipeline so that you can leverage a super low-cost approach to host a client-side React.js application.    Because of the limitation of S3 static web hosting of not supporting HTTPS, this project also instantiates a AWS CloudFront distribution to sit in front of the S3 bucket. 

## Usage
